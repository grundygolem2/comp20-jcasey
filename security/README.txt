I have fully completed the assignment.
I spent about three hours on this assignment.
Note: I did not fully complete the two brute force attacks as I was
worried about accidentally causing MongoDB or Heroku to start
charging Janeth. As a result, I cannot be completely sure that
Heroku itself does not prevent these sort of brute force attacks.
