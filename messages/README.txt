All aspects of the project have been completed
I have collaborated with no one
I spent about two hours on this project
It appears that XMLHttpRequest shouldn't be able to get data from a different origin based on the same origin policy, but in part two of the lab, my script properly loaded data from an URI, which means that it can. My conclusion is that XMLHttpRequest gets a copy of the remote data, thus maintaining the same origin origin policy.
